yeah baby
woooooo!!!!!!!!!!

why have so few people made fnf kigurumi/animegao/skinsuit content
i mean like, i appreciate the effort yall are putting in, but thus far we only have like two people making art on deviantart (neither of whom are active anymore, i think) and senpai is the only character to have an irl kigurumi mask. like, do yall not think bf and gf's headshapes are appealing enough??

also i think i fucked it up
